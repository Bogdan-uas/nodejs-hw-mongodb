# THIS IS NOT A WEBSITE, THAT'S A SERVICE!
(there is actually a "website", that is working on this code, but its purpose of existence is so the back-end works properly.)

A back-end app that does properly work on Postman. 

A service provides some "contacts"(all stored in JSON-format), which you can interact with. You can delete them, get all of them at once, get a single one by its id, create a new one or change some info about a specific contact. But you must know, all this can be done in Postman, with the link of deployed back-end.
