# THIS IS NOT A WEBSITE, THAT'S A SERVICE!

(there is actually a "website", that is working on this code, but its purpose of existence is so the code works and works properly.)

A back-end app that does properly work on Postman.

A service provides some "contacts"(all stored in JSON-format), which you can interact with.

You can ----->

Get all of them at once:

[!alt-text](image-1.1.png)

("{{domain}}" is the "website's" link)

Get a single one by its id:

delete them: , create a new one or change some info about a specific contact. But you must know, all this can be done in Postman(not on a "website"), with the link of deployed back-end.
